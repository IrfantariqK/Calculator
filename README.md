# Calculator
It appears that you have provided an HTML code snippet for a simple calculator. The code defines an HTML structure for a calculator interface with four arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The results are displayed in a <div> element with the class "result".

To make this calculator functional, you would typically need to include a JavaScript file referenced in the <script> tag. In this case, the JavaScript file is "function.js". The functions defined in that file, such as add(), subtract(), multiply(), and divide(), would handle the respective arithmetic operations and update the result in the HTML.

If you have any specific questions or need further assistance with this code, please let me know!
